# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
errors:
prefer_const_declarations: error

linter:
# The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
# section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
# included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
# and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
#
# Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
# section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
# or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
# `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
# producing the lint.
rules:
avoid_print: false # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
prefer_single_quotes: true # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
prefer_final_fields: true # Enforce the use of 'final' for field declarations
prefer_const_constructors: true # Encourage the use of 'const' constructors
unnecessary_brace_in_string_interps: true # Suggest removing unnecessary curly braces in string interpolations
prefer_typing_uninitialized_variables: true # Encourage explicitly typing uninitialized variables
camel_case_types: true # Enforce camel case for type names
camel_case_extensions: true # Enforce camel case for extension names
prefer_function_declarations_over_variables: true # Encourage using function declarations over variables
public_member_api_docs: true # Require public APIs to be documented
constant_identifier_names: true # Enforce UPPER_CASE for constant variable names
avoid_shadowing_type_parameters: true # Discourage shadowing of type parameters in generic types
unnecessary_this: true # Suggest removing unnecessary uses of 'this'
lines_longer_than_80_chars: true # Enforce a maximum line length of 80 characters
